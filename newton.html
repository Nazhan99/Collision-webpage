<h2><font face="arial">Who Was Isaac Newton?</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Isaac Newton (January 4, 1643 to March 31, 1727) was a physicist and mathematician who developed the principles of modern physics, including the laws of motion, 
and is credited as one of the great minds of the 17th century Scientific Revolution. In 1687, he published his most acclaimed work, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia 
Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), which has been called the single most influential book on physics. In 1705, he was knighted by Queen Anne
 of England, making him Sir Isaac Newton.</font><p>
 
 <br> 
 
<h2><font face="arial"> When Was Isaac Newton Born?</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Isaac Newton was born on January 4, 1643, in Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, England. Using the "old" Julien calendar, Newton's birth date is sometimes displayed as
						December 25, 1642.</font><p>

<h2><font face="arial">Isaac Newton's Discoveries</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Newton made discoveries in optics, motion and mathematics. Newton theorized that white light was a composite of all colors of the spectrum, and that light was
 composed of particles. His momentous book on physics, Principia, contains information on nearly all of the essential concepts of physics except energy, ultimately helping him to explain the laws of motion and
 the theory of gravity. Along with mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz, Newton is credited for developing essential theories of calculus.</font><p>
<br>

<h2><font face="arial">What Did Isaac Newton Invent?</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Newton's first major public scientific achievement was designing and constructing a reflecting telescope in 1668. As a professor at Cambridge, Newton was required to deliver an annual course of lectures and chose optics as his initial topic. He used his telescope to study optics and help prove his theory of light and color. The Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope in 1671, and the organization's interest encouraged Newton to publish his notes on light, optics and color in 1672. These notes were later published as part of Newton's Opticks: Or, A treatise of the Reflections, Refractions, Inflections and Colours of Light.

<h2><font face="arial">'Principia' and Newton's Laws of Motion</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">In 1687, following 18 months of intense and effectively nonstop work, Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), most often known as Principia. It is said to be the single most influential book on physics and possibly all of science. Its publication immediately raised Newton to international prominence.
<br>
<br>
Principia offers an exact quantitative description of bodies in motion, with three basic laws of motion: 

<ol>
<li>A stationary body will stay stationary unless an external force is applied to it</li>
<li>Force is equal to mass times acceleration, and a change in motion (i.e., change in speed) is proportional to the force applied</li>
<li>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</li>
</ol>

<h2><font face="arial">Legacy</font></h2>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Isaac Newton's fame grew even more after his death, as many of his contemporaries proclaimed him the greatest genius who ever lived. Maybe a slight exaggeration, but his discoveries had a large impact on Western thought, leading to comparisons to the likes of Plato, Aristotle and Galileo.
.</font><p>
<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Although his discoveries were among many made during the Scientific Revolution, Isaac Newton's universal principles of gravity found no parallels in science at the time. Of course, Newton was proven wrong on some of his key assumptions. In the 20th century, Albert Einstein would overturn Newton's concept of the universe, stating that space, distance and motion were not absolute but relative, and that the universe was more fantastic than Newton had ever conceived.
</font><p>

<p><font face="calibri" size="5" align="justify">Newton might not have been surprised: In his later life, when asked for an assessment of his achievements, he replied, "I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself now and then in finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."
